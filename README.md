Analyzing the dataset from the "Bank Fraud Detection using SQL
 can yield several meaningful insights into fraudulent activities within banking transactions. Here's a structured approach to uncovering these insights:
## Data Overview:
The dataset comprises various attributes related to banking transactions, including:

Transaction Type: Categorizes the nature of the transaction (e.g., payment, transfer).
Transaction Amount: Specifies the monetary value involved.
Origin and Destination Accounts: Identifiers for accounts initiating and receiving transactions.
Balance Information: Details the account balances before and after transactions.
Fraud Indicators: Flags indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.

## Project Overview
Bank fraud can have severe financial and reputational consequences. To mitigate these risks, we've developed a fraud detection system that uses SQL to analyze transaction data for patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. This repository contains SQL queries and scripts used to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data. The results provide insights and alerts for potentially fraudulent transactions.

**Data Source:** Kaggle
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure data quality. We've handled missing values, data transformations, and data merging to create a clean dataset ready for analysis.

## SQL Queries
This repository contains SQL queries for various aspects of the fraud detection system:
- Identification of anomalies in transaction data.
- Alert generation for suspicious activities.
- Customer profile analysis.

## Key Insights for CV: Fraud Analysis Using SQL
Transaction Distribution Across Types

# Conducted detailed transaction type analysis to determine fraud-prone categories.
-Found that TRANSFER and CASHOUT transactions dominate fraudulent activities.
-Fraudulent Transaction Trends

Identified the highest fraud occurrence in specific transaction types.
Enabled targeted fraud detection for high-risk transaction categories.
Fraud Amount Analysis

Determined the average fraudulent transaction amount to be highly significant for financial loss mitigation.
Identified maximum and minimum fraud transaction amounts, helping set fraud detection thresholds.
High-Risk Customers

Analyzed fraudulent activity per customer to identify top 10 defrauded customers.
Assisted in prioritizing high-risk customer monitoring for early fraud detection.
Bank’s Fraud Detection Effectiveness

Measured fraud flagging accuracy: Only 0.16% of high-value fraud transactions were correctly flagged.
Discovered over 10,000 fraud cases that went undetected, highlighting gaps in fraud detection algorithms.
Suggested improvements for fraud flagging mechanisms to enhance detection rates.
Top Fraudsters and Their Behavior

Identified the top 20 fraudulent accounts, revealing patterns in fraudulent fund movement.
Established monitoring protocols for repeat offenders to mitigate financial losses.
Fraud Prevention Strategies

Suggested machine learning-based anomaly detection for better fraud flagging.
Recommended real-time monitoring for high-value transactions.
Advocated for enhanced transaction pattern analysis using advanced SQL techniques.
Impact & Achievements
✅ Performed advanced SQL fraud analysis on banking transactions.
✅ Identified critical fraud patterns, customer risk, and transaction vulnerabilities.
✅ Proposed fraud detection improvements to strengthen financial security.
